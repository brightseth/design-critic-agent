# BATCH EVALUATION GUIDE

## UPLOAD STRATEGY
Upload 20-50 images at once for optimal Nina performance. The algorithm works best with variety to establish relative rankings.

## WHAT NINA EVALUATES

### WEIGHTED DIMENSIONS
- **Paris Photo Readiness (30%)**: Gallery-quality presentation, professional impact
- **AI-Criticality (25%)**: Advances the medium, computational aesthetics
- **Conceptual Strength (20%)**: Intellectual depth, artistic vision
- **Technical Excellence (15%)**: Execution quality, compositional mastery
- **Cultural Dialogue (10%)**: Contemporary relevance, discourse engagement

### GATE CHECKS (Must Pass All)
- ✓ **Compositional Integrity**: Strong visual structure, intentional framing
- ✓ **Artifact Control**: Minimal AI artifacts, clean execution
- ✓ **Ethics Process**: No problematic content, responsible generation

## READING THE RESULTS

### SCORE TIERS
- **85-100%**: Exhibition ready, strong Paris Photo candidates
- **75-84%**: Include tier, good candidates with minor refinements
- **55-74%**: Maybe tier, potential with significant work
- **<55%**: Exclude tier, not suitable for major exhibition

### Z-SCORE NORMALIZATION
Nina uses statistical normalization so scores reflect relative quality within your batch. A 90% in one batch might be 85% in another - focus on the rankings and tier placement.

## ACTION ITEMS BY SCORE

### TOP PERFORMERS (85%+)
1. Move to "Paris Photo Candidates" collection
2. Analyze what made them successful
3. Use in Series Coherence analysis
4. Consider for A/B testing refinement

### INCLUDE TIER (75-84%)
1. Review gate check failures
2. Consider prompt enhancement suggestions
3. Group thematically in collections
4. Use for Nina learning feedback

### MAYBE TIER (55-74%)
1. Analyze failure points in Nina Studio
2. Use Prompt Lab for improvement suggestions
3. Consider for style mixing experiments
4. Archive but don't delete - useful for learning

### EXCLUDE TIER (<55%)
1. Use for negative feedback training
2. Analyze systematic issues
3. Archive as learning examples
4. Don't include in collections

## MAXIMIZING BATCH VALUE
- Include diverse styles/subjects for better normalization
- Upload chronologically similar work (same generation session)
- Save high-performing prompts for future reference
- Use results to train Nina's artist fingerprint for you
