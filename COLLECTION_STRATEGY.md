**Purpose**: Focused artistic statements
- **Coherence Target**: 85%+
- **Score Range**: 75-100%
- **Narrative Arc**: Clear beginning/middle/end
- **Technical Consistency**: Similar aesthetic approach

### 3. EXPERIMENTAL COLLECTION (12-20 images)

## USING NINA STUDIO FOR COLLECTIONS

### CREATION WORKFLOW
1. **Collections Tab** â†’ Create Collection
2. Name with purpose: "Paris Photo Flagship 2025"
3. Set target size (influences coherence algorithm)
4. Add theme description for AI analysis

### BUILDING PROCESS
1. Start with highest-scoring images from batch evaluation
2. Add images using "Add to Collection" from any Nina interface
3. Assign roles: **hero** (1-2 images), **supporting** (majority), **accent** (2-3 images)
4. Tag thematically for Nina's coherence analysis

### COHERENCE OPTIMIZATION
Nina analyzes:
- **Score Variance**: Consistent quality levels
- **Visual Style**: Color, composition, technique harmony  
- **Thematic Consistency**: Conceptual alignment
- **Narrative Flow**: Logical progression for viewing

### EXHIBITION READINESS CHECKS
- **70%+ Coherence Score**: Minimum for exhibition
- **No Gate Failures**: All images pass integrity/artifact/ethics
- **Balanced Scoring**: Mix of heroes (90%+) and strong supporting (80%+)
- **Curatorial Statement**: Generated by Nina's analysis

## COLLECTION MANAGEMENT TIPS

### ITERATIVE REFINEMENT
1. Build initial collection from top batch results
2. Run coherence analysis
3. Swap out weak links (lowest coherence contributors)
4. Re-analyze until target coherence reached
5. Use A/B testing for final selection decisions

### CROSS-COLLECTION STRATEGY
- Move images between collections to find optimal groupings
- Use same image in multiple collections for different contexts
- Build themed sub-collections from larger pools
- Maintain "parking lot" collection for strong images without homes

### DOCUMENTATION
- Export curatorial statements for gallery descriptions
- Save coherence analysis for exhibition planning
- Document Nina's reasoning for future reference
- Track which combinations work best for learning

## SUCCESS METRICS
- **Technical**: 70%+ coherence, 85%+ average scores
- **Curatorial**: Clear artistic statement, professional presentation
- **Commercial**: Gallery-ready, Paris Photo submission quality
- **Innovation**: Showcases AI medium advancement

**Start with one flagship collection of your strongest 10 images and optimize from there.**
