Your complete AI curation system is live and ready for real work:
- **Main Nina**: https://design-critic-agent.vercel.app
- **Nina Studio**: https://design-critic-agent.vercel.app/nina-studio.html

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. START WITH BATCH EVALUATION
- Go to **Main Nina** → **Batch Mode**
- Upload 20-50 of Solienne's recent AI outputs
- Nina will rank them by Paris Photo readiness (weighted algorithm)
- Focus on images scoring 75%+ (INCLUDE threshold)

### 2. BUILD YOUR FIRST COLLECTION
- Switch to **Nina Studio** → **Collections tab**
- Create collection: "Paris Photo Candidates 2025"
- Add top-scoring images from batch evaluation
- Use Nina's coherence analysis to ensure exhibition readiness

### 3. TRAIN NINA ON YOUR TASTE
- **Learning & Feedback tab** in Studio
- Review Nina's evaluations of images you know well
- Submit feedback when you disagree
- Nina learns your specific preferences and Paris Photo criteria

### 4. REFINE WITH A/B TESTING
- **A/B Testing tab** for close decisions
- Compare similar images head-to-head
- Nina uses Bradley-Terry tournament ranking
- Perfect for final selection decisions

## PRO TIPS
- Start with images you're confident about to train Nina
- Use collections to group by theme/series for coherent exhibitions
- The system learns - the more you use it, the better it gets
- All data persists in Supabase, so your curation work builds over time
