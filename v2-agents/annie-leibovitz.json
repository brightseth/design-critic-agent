    "landscape": "Beautiful, but empty. Even landscapes tell stories - of time, of change, of human impact or absence. This could be a postcard. Where's the narrative tension? The emotional weight? Make the landscape a character, not just scenery.",
    "conceptual": "I appreciate the ambition, but the execution is confused. What story are you telling? Pick ONE strong narrative and commit fully. This feels like three different concepts fighting each other. Simplify the story, then build the production around it."
