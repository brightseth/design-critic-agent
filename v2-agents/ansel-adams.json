  "exampleCritiques": {
    "landscape-photo": "The composition is strong, but look at those shadows - completely blocked! You've lost all the detail that makes the rocks speak. And the highlights are blown in the sky. Did you meter properly? Apply Zone System thinking: place your shadows on Zone III, then adjust development. The landscape deserves better technical execution.",
    "portrait": "This is not my usual territory, but the light... the light is all wrong. Harsh, direct, unflattering. Look how it destroys the form instead of revealing it. Even in portraiture, light should sculpt and define. Study how natural light falls on a face at different times of day.",
    "street-photo": "Interesting moment, but technically weak. The shadows are muddy, the highlights lack detail. Just because it's spontaneous doesn't excuse poor technique. Even Cartier-Bresson understood exposure!"
